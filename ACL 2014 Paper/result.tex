Word Relatedness Computation
In this task, we use two different datasets, wordsim-240 and wordsim-296 to evaluate the semantic relateness of word emmbeddings given by each model. The correlations between results of models and human judgements are reported as the model performance. 
In wordsim-240, there are 240 pairs of Chinese words and human-labeled relatedness scores, of which the 233 word pairs have appeared in the learning corpus. In wordsim-296, the words in 280 word pairs have appeared in the learning corpus and the left 16 pairs have new words.
We compute the Spearman correlation œÅ between relatedness scores from a model and the human judgements for comparison. The evaluation results of our model and baseline methods on wordsim-240 and wordsim-296 are shown in Table 2
